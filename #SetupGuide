Follow these instructions to ensure the application runs correctly.

Pre-requisites: 
Download and install the lastest .NET-Connector from www.mysql.com
Access to MySql connection
Visual Studio

STEP 1
________________
Create a new Windows Form App (.NET Framework) in Visual Studio

STEP2
________________
Add the MySQL.Data.dll in Visual Studio to your project references (Menu: project --> [application name] Properties --> References).

STEP 3
________________
Create the following 8 user-scoped settings in Settings.settings, each with Type "String" and empty values:
Client, CSVFile, DBName, DBUsername, DBPassword, Product, Salespeople, ServerName

STEP 4
________________
Create 4 additional forms in a Visual Studio with default names (Form2, Form3 etc.). Do not rename the forms. 
Copy and paste the code in to the corresponding forms.

STEP 5
________________
Run the MYsqlcreate script in your MySql database. Please ensure the sql command is able to execute and no databases already exist
with the same name ( database name is test in the Mysqlcreate code by default ) 

Step 6
________________
The application will need several text files on your desktop to run. You can manually create 4 files: Salespeople, Products, Clients and Sales Records.

Alternatively, you can use the CommandLine commands in "#optional Create Text Files" to create the files automatically. 



ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
________________
Settings.Designer.vb and App.Config do not need to be copy and pasted into your Visual Studio project, however your project should 
change their Settings.Designer.vb and App.Config files to reflect the ones in this repository.
