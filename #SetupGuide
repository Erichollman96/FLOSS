Follow these instructions to ensure the application runs correctly.

Pre-requisites: 
Download and install the lastest .NET-Connector from www.mysql.com
Access to MySql connection
Visual Studio
.NET 7.0+

STEP 1
________________
Create a new Windows Form App (.NET Framework) in Visual Studio

STEP 2
________________
Run the MYsqlcreate script in your MySql database. Please ensure the sql command is able to execute and no databases already exist
with the same name ( database name is test in the Mysqlcreate code by default ) 

Step 3

The application will need several text files on your desktop to run.

You can manually create 4 files: Salespeople, Products, Clients and Sales Records to run the test environment. Please set these to fit your environment for live environments. 

Alternatively, you can use the CommandLine commands in "#optional Create Text Files" to create the files automatically. 

Copy and paste the entire document into Command Prompt and accept the creation of the new text files, they will have placeholder names
for clients, salespeople and products.
